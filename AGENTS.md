# cache-tool317 — Agent Instructions

## Current Work

**Done:**
- All cache I/O: `Buffer`, `CacheReader`, `Archive`
- All definition parsers: `ItemDef`, `NpcDef`, `LocDef`, `FloDef`, `SeqDef`, `SpotAnimDef`, `VarbitDef`, `VarpDef`, `MesAnimDef`, `MesDef`, `ParamDef`, `IdkDef`
- Map parsing: `MapRegion`, `MapTerrain`, `MapObjects`
- 2D map renderer: `RegionRenderer2D`

**In progress:**
- `ModelDef` parser — reading raw vertex/triangle bytes from cache from scratch
- Going slow: understand the raw byte format fully before attempting rendering

**Up next:**
1. OpenGL model renderer (user is a beginner with OpenGL — step by step)
2. 3D map renderer (objects placed on terrain)

**End goal:**
Full RS317 client + integrated cache editor — modify any game file (items, map, models, etc.) and write it back to the cache.

---

## What This Is

A **RuneScape 317 cache tool** written in **C++20** with **CMake**.

The end goal is a fully customizable cache tool (read, write, create assets) plus a game client. Both share the `core` library.

**GitHub:** https://github.com/antoineb34/cache-tool317

## Build

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON
cmake --build build
```

Binaries:
- `build/bin/tool` — CLI cache inspection tool
- `build/bin/client` — windowed game client (currently empty — model renderer being built)

## Collaboration Rules

- **The user is the main brain.** They decide what to build, what to name things, and the direction.
- **The agent executes.** Write code based on the user's direction. Don't design independently.
- **Think together before writing.** Present a plan, let the user confirm or redirect, then write.
- **Do one thing at a time.** Don't write multiple systems at once.
- **Always build and verify after every change.**
- **Keep docs in sync automatically.** Whenever the project direction, current work, or agent behavior rules change, update `Current Work` in this file and any relevant `docs/` files. The user should never have to update docs manually.
- **Use feature branches.** Never push significant changes directly to `main`. Create a branch (`feature/`, `fix/`, `refactor/` prefix), work on it, then merge when done. `main` stays stable.

## Coding Conventions

- **C++20**, **GCC**, **CMake 3.20+**
- Each major type gets its own `.h` + `.cpp` pair
- Use `Buffer` for ALL sequential byte reading — never raw `data[offset]` arithmetic inline
- Unknown opcodes in parsers throw `std::runtime_error` (strict parsing)
- Public API is clean and minimal — implementation details go `private`
- Include guards: `#pragma once`
- No namespaces — flat global structs and functions (matches existing style)
- Error handling: throw `std::runtime_error` with descriptive messages

## Sacred Areas

- **`core/` cache parsing code** — user fully understands it. Ask before modifying.
- **`Buffer.h/cpp`** — the universal byte reader. Used everywhere.
- **`CacheReader.h/cpp`** — the cache I/O layer.

## External Dependencies

- `BZip2` — Jagex BZIP2 decompression
- `ZLIB` — GZIP decompression
- `SDL3` — window, input, events
- `OpenGL` — rendering (client only)
